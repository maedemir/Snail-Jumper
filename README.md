# Snail-Jumper
This project is an implementation of evolutionary algorithms and neural networks(Neuroevolution) for Computational Intelligence course at AUT.

The game is simple! a runner agent needs to jump over obstacls(snails and bugs) to survive. you can run the game in 2 modes: 1)manual mode which you can play and enjoy(the agent jumps left and right using "space bar", see? not that sophisticated). 2)Neuroevoloution mode which is even more exciting because you don't have to bother tapping on space 🥳! a generetion of 300 agents are produced at the very beginning. In the next generations, you'll see that agents are acting better because of evoloution! 
### The goal of this project is to implement an accurate neuroevoloution algorithm so that agents get better in each new generation.

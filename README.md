The game is simple! a runner agent needs to jump over obstacls(snails and bugs) to survive. The game can be run in 2 modes: 1)manual mode which you can play and enjoy( it jumps left and right using "space bar", see? not that sophisticated). 2)Neuroevoloution mode which is even more exciting because you don't have to bother! a generetion of 300 agents are produced at the very beginning. In the next generations, you'll see that agents are acting better because of evoloution!
